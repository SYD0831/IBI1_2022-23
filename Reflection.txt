# Third note on 7/1/21, yes! I can make changes in both directions!!

# Second note from 7/1/21, I managed to get changes on the ZJE server onto GitHub but can I make changes on the website and send them back?

# Note from 7/1/21, I have cloned this repo onto the ZJE server and am now going to attempt to push it back onto GitHub.

This is an example file for reflection in IBI1_2019-20.


Practical 4
During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.

I have also learnt to write careful instructions when communicating online!
Problem 1: My website content is not different from the template file

Solution: I changed the background of my website and add my greetings.

Problem 2: My website is not formatted.

Solution: I changed the content of “Markdown” part to make it formatted.

Problem 3: Commit messages for Week 4 are not informative. They are all “Initialise”.

Solution: I changed the commit messages from “Initialise” into “Update the Introduction.txt”, “Update the Reflection.txt”, and “Update thingsIlike.txt”.




Practical 5

Problem 1: I did not compare d and e.

Solution: I added codes to compare. You can test it in my portfolio.

    if d < e:
	  print("The rate of new cases was greater in 2021")
	else:
	  print("The rate of new cases was greater in 2020")

The result is “The rate of new cases is greater in 2021”.

Problem 2: W should be true only if both X and Y are True. But my codes are not Booleans.

Solution: I defined W as "X and Y”. Besides, I tried all possibilities of X and Y. I wrote the result in my pseudocode. This meets the principle of Booleans in python.

Problem 3: In the mystery_code.py, there is a commented line that says what the code does. However, my answer is wrong.

Solution: I changed my answer to “Make the loop run 10 times to choose ten random numbers between 1 and 100 and then print the last number.” I think this answer is correct.




Practical 6

Problem 1: In file for looking at the relationship between paternal age and offspring health exists, my plot has no labels.

Solution: I added the labels. The x axis label is "Paternal age". The y axis label is "Relative risk of congenital heart disease".

Problem 2: In file for list manipulation exists, I should display a well-labelled plot, but my plot has no labels.

Solution: I added the labels. The x axis label is “Student Name”. The y axis label is “IBI Marks”.
